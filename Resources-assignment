Swift

* A language used for developing software for apple devices. I am using swift partially because it is made for developing software for apple devices. In addition, if I wish to use a different language, I will face various inconveniences I do not wish to deal with. Hence, I would rather learn and use Swift.

SwiftUI

* A framework for making UI elements with Swift. I decided to use this largely for ease of use; Xcode already has support for it and using something else would require jumping through a number of extra hoops.

Core Data

* A framework for databases, usually based on SQLite. It allows for a higher level of interaction with setting up and using the database and is similar to ER diagrams in the way it is structured. I am using Core Data because Xcode has features built in for its use, which I feel will make it easier for me to achieve what I want in the time frame I have. Further, I believe that using this will also make it easier to implement some features I want later on.

Xcode

* A developing environment for making software for apple devices. It is not entirely impossible to make software for appleâ€™s devices outside of Xcode, but it is difficult and includes a number of inconvenience. Xcode can only be run on MacOS. I choose to use Xcode to avoid these inconveniences and difficulties.

Canva

* A graphic design platform. I will use Canva in order to create designs and data relationships before their implementation. I choose to use Canva because I am familiar with it and know it will allow me to do everything that I want to do when planning.

GitHub

* A platform that allows for the storage of code and version control, among other things. I plan to use GitHub to save my work and allow for version control. The reason I choose GitHub is because I am somewhat familiar with it and feel that it will help keep me organized.
