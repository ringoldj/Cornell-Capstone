## Questions

How much time should be spent on planning versus working on the project?
How much should planned ahead, and how much should be decided while writing code?
When is it time to stop working and go back to planning?
How did you track your progress?
How should utility of a tool be weighed against the time it takes to learn?
How do you determine how long you think it will take you to learn a tool?
When is it time to seek help versus trying to just figure things out yourself?

## Version Control

I used GitHub to store my code and save any changes I made with commit messages. I did not have to ever go back to an older version of the code, however. In terms of  learning, I learned how to connect GitHub to Xcode, so that I could push changes from Xcode. I also learned a little bit about using licenses on GitHub, but ultimately decided to just keep my code private instead.

## Agile Development

For almost every day, I had something to show for my work. I did not place a great emphasis on my work being divided into stories, tasks, and sprints, but how I worked did follow this model somewhat loosely. I effectively had a new sprint for achieving the minimum viable product, alpha release, and beta release each. Within those sprints, I broke up work into features I wanted, essentially stories, and further broke those up into tasks to complete the features. This said, my work flowed somewhat freely between tasks that may not be entirely related to each other, differing a bit from traditional Agile development. I did this because ultimately, the tasks were all required to be done within each sprint, and I found working this way to be easier for me.
